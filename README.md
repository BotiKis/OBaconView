#What is OBaconView?
**OpenBaconView** is a animated hovering-views-view with datasource/delegate like a tableView for iOS.

#Background:
I used this in a private Project of mine and decided to give it to the public.

##Set up:
You will need to add QuartzCore Framework to your project as the OBaconView directory and you can start.

##Usage:
Init it like any other view, set datasource (and delegate if you need it), implement the methods and you are done.

##ARC
This project uses only ARC.  
If you are not using ARC in your project, add `-fobjc-arc` as a compiler flag for all the files of OBaconView.

##Q&A
Q: Why "Bacon"?  
A: I haven't found a name that fits so i took something i like. I'm open to any better ideas.  

Q: Are you serious with the sample project?  
A: F*** yeah, I am.  

Q: Are you sorry for that?  
A: Nope.
